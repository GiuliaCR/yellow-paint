        <p>Queer temporality is folded time. Encountering our own queer history through our memory folding back onto itself, revealing more of our true self with each fold.</p>
        <p>Rewinding through my childhood videos I try to spot signs of what’s to come, revisiting them as a portal to my own history, illuminated by my present knowledge. Did my younger self already know who she would become? Where she would go? Who she would love?</p>
        <p>There is a freedom in the way I move my body, unencumbered by any desire to adhere to societal expectation or simply unaware. In a way, this younger self seems closer to my present self that then closeted years in between – they are me when I am free to be my full self.</p>
        <p>Folding time is the continuous/growing/looping/never-ending process of self-understanding and becoming.</p>
