            <p>As a child I found a lot of solace in praying and other repetitive rituals. Growing up catholic, while my family wasn’t particularly practising, religion permeated a lot of what was around me: culture, media, friendships. All my friends went to Sunday school. All my classmates had been baptised.</p>
			<p>When I started questioning my faith and decided to leave the church, my family didn’t mind. Their own relationship with religion was always fluctuating – or better, they didn’t find it particularly worthy of note. We were catholic because everyone else was. Religion was just background noise.</p>

			<p>All things considered, I’ve not been as scarred by growing up catholic as many other queer people have been. My parents always taught me and my sister to reject the parts of christianity they found absurd – abstinence, anti-abortion sentiments, homosexuality as an eternal sin – and embrace the parts about love and kindness. It was very pick and mix, but with catholic dogmas.</p>
			<p>Still, looking back, I wonder how much religion has impacted me. Thanks to my parents, I never thought I’d go to hell for being gay, but I also never thought anything but heteronormativity would be possible. I wouldn’t have been able to imagine the life I have now, living in another country with my wife. Marrying a man and having his children seemed like the only option for a long time. You can’t be what you don’t see.</p>
